# STM8L_blink
This repository is part of my Masterthesis - Applied Computer Sciences (HTW Berlin)


Hardware:
- ST-link v2
- HIMO (01)M with
  - STM8L051F3 MCU
  (- SX1278 Lora Module)

Software:
- Cosmic C compiler
- STVD IDE
- STVP 


Open the .stw File as a Workspace inside STVD IDE. 
Rebuild all and start debiggung with the Debugging Instrument SWIM ST-link v2.
A file .s19 will be created in the Debug Folder. This can be opened in the STVP programm to have a deeper look into the debugging and the registers.
